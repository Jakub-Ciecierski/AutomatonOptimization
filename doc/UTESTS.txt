1)
Only include header files from the main project that you want to test
  in test project
    #include "main.h" - Good
Never the source it self
    #include "main.cpp" - Wrong!!

2)
You can include header file from main project without specifying the
path <=> The test project has a path to includes of main project

3)
Sources from main project are already compiled together with test project
